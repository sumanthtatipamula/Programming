## Problem Statement

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called `root`.

Besides the `root`, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if **two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given the `root` of the binary tree, return _the maximum amount of money the thief can rob **without alerting the police**_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.

```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/rob2-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]
Output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.

```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10<sup>4</sup>]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 10<sup>4</sup>`

## Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def rob(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        # 0 - inclusive 1 - exclusive
        def dfs(root):
            if(not root):
                return [0, 0]
            left = dfs(root.left)
            right = dfs(root.right)
            inc, exc = root.val + left[-1] + right[-1], max(left) + max(right)
            return [inc, exc]
        return max(dfs(root))
```
