## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, find the largest

, which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST), where the largest means subtree has the largest number of nodes.

A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a tree in which all the nodes follow the below-mentioned properties:

- The left subtree values are less than the value of their parent (root) node's value.
- The right subtree values are greater than the value of their parent (root) node's value.

**Note:** A subtree must include all of its descendants.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [10,5,15,1,8,null,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The Largest BST Subtree in this case is the highlighted one. The return value is the subtree's size, which is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [4,2,7,2,3,5,null,2,null,null,null,null,null,1]
Output: 2

```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 10<sup>4</sup>]`.
- `-10<sup>4</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>4</sup>`

**Follow up:** Can you figure out ways to solve it with `O(n)` time complexity?

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def largestBSTSubtree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        def traverse(root):
            if(not root):
                return [float("Inf"), -float("Inf"), 0] # min, max, count
            left = traverse(root.left)
            right = traverse(root.right)
            if(root.val > left[1] and root.val < right[0]):
                return [min(root.val,left[0]), max(root.val,right[1]), left[-1] + right[-1] + 1]
            return [-float("Inf"), float("Inf"), max(left[-1], right[-1])]
        return traverse(root)[-1]
```
