## Problem Statement

A tree rooted at node 0 is given as follows:

- The number of nodes is `nodes`;
- The value of the `i<sup>th</sup>` node is `value[i]`;
- The parent of the `i<sup>th</sup>` node is `parent[i]`.

Remove every subtree whose sum of values of nodes is zero.

Return _the number of the remaining nodes in the tree_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nodes = 7, parent = [-1,0,0,1,2,2,2], value = [1,-2,4,0,-2,-1,-1]
Output: 2

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nodes = 7, parent = [-1,0,0,1,2,2,2], value = [1,-2,4,0,-2,-1,-2]
Output: 6

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nodes <= 10<sup>4</sup>`
- `parent.length == nodes`
- `0 <= parent[i] <= nodes - 1`
- `parent[0] == -1` which indicates that `0` is the root.
- `value.length == nodes`
- `-10<sup>5</sup> <= value[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
- The given input is **guaranteed** to represent a **valid tree**.

## Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def deleteTreeNodes(self, nodes: int, parent: List[int], value: List[int]) -> int:
        adj = defaultdict(list)
        for v, u in enumerate(parent):
            adj[u].append(v)
        def dfs(source):
            total_val = value[source]
            total_elements = 1
            for child in adj[source]:
                val, elements = dfs(child)
                total_val += val
                total_elements += elements
            if(total_val == 0):
                return [0, 0]
            return [total_val, total_elements]
        return dfs(0)[-1]
```
