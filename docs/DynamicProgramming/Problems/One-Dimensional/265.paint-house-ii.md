## Problem Statement

There are a row of `n` houses, each house can be painted with one of the `k` colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an `n x k` cost matrix costs.

- For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house `0` with color `0`; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house `1` with color `2`, and so on...

Return _the minimum cost to paint all houses_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: costs = [[1,5,3],[2,9,4]]
Output: 5
Explanation:
Paint house 0 into color 0, paint house 1 into color 2. Minimum cost: 1 + 4 = 5;
Or paint house 0 into color 2, paint house 1 into color 0. Minimum cost: 3 + 2 = 5.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: costs = [[1,3],[2,4]]
Output: 5

```

**Constraints:**

- `costs.length == n`
- `costs[i].length == k`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `2 <= k <= 20`
- `1 <= costs[i][j] <= 20`

**Follow up:** Could you solve it in `O(nk)` runtime?

## Solution

```python

class Solution:
    def minCostII(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        first_min = 0
        second_min = 1
        for i in range(0, len(costs[0])):
            if(costs[-1][i] < costs[-1][first_min]):
                second_min = first_min
                first_min = i
            elif(costs[-1][i] < costs[-1][second_min] and i != first_min):
                second_min = i
        print(first_min, second_min)
        for i in range(len(costs) - 2, -1, -1):
            new_first_min = None
            new_second_min = None
            for j in range(0, len(costs[0])):
                if(first_min != j):
                    costs[i][j] += costs[i + 1][first_min]
                else:
                    costs[i][j] += costs[i + 1][second_min]
                if(new_first_min == None or costs[i][j] < costs[i][new_first_min]):
                    new_second_min = new_first_min
                    new_first_min = j
                elif(new_second_min == None or costs[i][j] < costs[i][new_second_min]):
                    new_second_min = j
            first_min = new_first_min
            second_min = new_second_min
        return min(costs[0])

```
