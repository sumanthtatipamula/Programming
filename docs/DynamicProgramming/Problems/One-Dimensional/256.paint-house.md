## Problem Statement

There is a row of `n` houses, where each house can be painted one of three colors: red, blue, or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an `n x 3` cost matrix `costs`.

- For example, `costs[0][0]` is the cost of painting house `0` with the color red; `costs[1][2]` is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on...

Return _the minimum cost to paint all houses_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: costs = [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
Output: 10
Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.
Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: costs = [[7,6,2]]
Output: 2

```

**Constraints:**

- `costs.length == n`
- `costs[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= costs[i][j] <= 20`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, costs: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        for i in range(len(costs) - 2, -1, -1):
            for j in range(0, 3):
                costs[i][j] += min(costs[i + 1][(j + 1) % 3], costs[i + 1][(j + 2) % 3])
        return min(costs[0])

```
