        There are two distinct phases 
        <ul>
              <li> <b>Creating an object of a specific type or for a specific purpose</b>: You want to create an object sometime when the application runs but you want to maintain a consistent and easy-to-use way of creating instances of these objects. Every so often you want to control what parameters to use, what category of objects to create, or how to reuse some functionality and clone objects based on existing ones. </li>
              <li> <b>Managing the object life cycle</b>: You want to control how many instances of the object exist and where they are stored. You also want to be able to safely destroy those instances when they are no longer required. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
