#
# You are given an integer n, the number of nodes in a directed graph where the
# nodes are labeled from 0 to n - 1. Each edge is red or blue in this graph,
# and there could be self-edges and parallel edges.
# 
# You are given two arrays redEdges and blueEdges where:
# 
# 
# redEdges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is a directed red edge from node
# ai to node bi in the graph, and
# blueEdges[j] = [uj, vj] indicates that there is a directed blue edge from
# node uj to node vj in the graph.
# 
# 
# Return an array answer of length n, where each answer[x] is the length of the
# shortest path from node 0 to node x such that the edge colors alternate along
# the path, or -1 if such a path does not exist.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 3, redEdges = [[0,1],[1,2]], blueEdges = []
# Output: [0,1,-1]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 3, redEdges = [[0,1]], blueEdges = [[2,1]]
# Output: [0,1,-1]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= n <= 100
# 0 <= redEdges.length,Â blueEdges.length <= 400
# redEdges[i].length == blueEdges[j].length == 2
# 0 <= ai, bi, uj, vj < n
# 
#
