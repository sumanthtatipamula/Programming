### Pre-requisites

---

- [x] [Detect Cycle in an Undirected Graph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXrv3kruvwE)
- [x] [Bi Partite Graph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ACfAqs8mm0)
  - Bi Partite graph will always have even length cycle
- [x] [Kruskal Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Iz-QLBGKpM)
  - No of vertices = V
  - No of edges in MST = (V - 1)
  - MST an be found only for connected graphs
  - Kruskal Algorithm is a greedy algorithm
  - Steps:
    - Sort all the edges in increasing order of their weight
    - loop until (v - 1) edges are included
      - Pick the smallest edge
      - check if the new edge forms a cycle in our existing spanning tree being formed
      - if cycle is not formed - include else - discard
- [x] [Minimum Height Trees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivl6BHJVcB0)
  - There can be atmost 2 MHT's
