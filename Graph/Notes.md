1.  One graph can have atmost k * (k - 1) edges where k is number of vertices
2. There are many representations for graphs, there are two of them are popular
	1. Adjacency Matrix
	2. Adjacency List
3.  Adjacency List comes in handy when  $|E| Â \approx |V|^{2}$ or wjen we need to be able to telll quickly if there is an edges connecting two given vertices
