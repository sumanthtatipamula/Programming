#
# In an infinite binary tree where every node has two children, the nodes are
# labelled in row order.
# 
# In the odd numbered rows (ie., the first, third, fifth,...), the labelling is
# left to right, while in the even numbered rows (second, fourth, sixth,...),
# the labelling is right to left.
# 
# 
# 
# Given the label of a node in this tree, return the labels in the path from
# the root of the tree to theÂ node with that label.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: label = 14
# Output: [1,3,4,14]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: label = 26
# Output: [1,2,6,10,26]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= label <= 10^6
#
