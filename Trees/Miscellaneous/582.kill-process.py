# Testcase Example:  '[1,3,10,5]\n[3,0,5,3]\n5'
#
# You have n processes forming a rooted tree structure. You are given two
# integer arrays pid and ppid, where pid[i] is the ID of the i^th process and
# ppid[i] is the ID of the i^th process's parent process.
# 
# Each process has only one parent process but may have multiple children
# processes. Only one process has ppid[i] = 0, which means this process has no
# parent process (the root of the tree).
# 
# When a process is killed, all of its children processes will also be killed.
# 
# Given an integer kill representing the ID of a process you want to kill,
# return a list of the IDs of the processes that will be killed. You may return
# the answer in any order.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: pid = [1,3,10,5], ppid = [3,0,5,3], kill = 5
# Output: [5,10]
# Explanation:Â The processes colored in red are the processes that should be
# killed.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: pid = [1], ppid = [0], kill = 1
# Output: [1]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# n == pid.length
# n == ppid.length
# 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
# 1 <= pid[i] <= 5 * 10^4
# 0 <= ppid[i] <= 5 * 10^4
# Only one process has no parent.
# All the values of pid are unique.
# kill is guaranteed to be in pid.
# 
#

class Solution:
    def killProcess(self, pid: List[int], ppid: List[int], kill: int) -> List[int]:
        processmap = defaultdict(list)
        for i in range(len(pid)):
            processmap[ppid[i]].append(pid[i])
        result = []
        queue = deque([kill])
        while(queue):
            node = queue.popleft()
            result.append(node)
            for child in processmap[node]:
                queue.append(child)
        return result
