# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4,5]'
#
# Given the root of a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing
# this:
# 
# 
# Collect all the leaf nodes.
# Remove all the leafÂ nodes.
# Repeat until the tree is empty.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
# Explanation:
# [[3,5,4],[2],[1]] and [[3,4,5],[2],[1]] are also considered correct answers
# since per each level it does not matter the order on which elements are
# returned.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1]
# Output: [[1]]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
# 
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def findLeaves(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        result = []
        def traverse(root):
            if(not root):
                return 0
            left = traverse(root.left)
            right = traverse(root.right)
            order = max(left,right) + 1
            if(order > len(result)):
                result.append([root.val])
            else:
                result[order - 1].append(root.val)
            return order
        traverse(root)
        return result
