 *
 * Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using
 * the following operations:
 * 
 * 
 * Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters.
 * 
 * 
 * For example, abcde -> aecdb
 * 
 * 
 * Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into
 * another existing character, and do the same with the other
 * character.
 * 
 * For example, aacabb -> bbcbaa (all a's turn into b's, and all b's turn into
 * a's)
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * You can use the operations on either string as many times as necessary.
 * 
 * Given two strings, word1 and word2, return true if word1 and word2 are
 * close, and false otherwise.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 2 operations.
 * Apply Operation 1: "abc" -> "acb"
 * Apply Operation 1: "acb" -> "bca"
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: word1 = "a", word2 = "aa"
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: It is impossible to attain word2 from word1, or vice versa, in
 * any number of operations.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: word1 = "cabbba", word2 = "abbccc"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 3 operations.
 * Apply Operation 1: "cabbba" -> "caabbb"
 * Apply Operation 2: "caabbb" -> "baaccc"
 * Apply Operation 2: "baaccc" -> "abbccc"
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 10^5
 * word1 and word2 containÂ only lowercase English letters.
 *
