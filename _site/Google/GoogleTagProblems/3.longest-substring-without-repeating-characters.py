# Testcase Example:  '"abcabcbb"'
#
# Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating
# characters.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "abcabcbb"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "bbbbb"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "pwwkew"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
# Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a
# substring.
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: s = ""
# Output: 0
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
# s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
#
