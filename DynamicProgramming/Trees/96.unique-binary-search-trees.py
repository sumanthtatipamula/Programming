#
# Given an integer n, return the number of structurally unique BST's (binary
# search trees) which has exactly n nodes of unique values from 1 to n.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 3
# Output: 5
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: n = 1
# Output: 1
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= n <= 19
#

class Solution:
    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 1
        dp[1] = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j]
        return dp[n]
